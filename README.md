# VQE_phi4_field_theory
Implements a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to find the ground state of a discretized ϕ⁴ scalar field theory. Builds the lattice Hamiltonian, embeds it into qubit space, enforces physical constraints, and runs a PennyLane VQE to compare quantum and exact energies with convergence plots.
